# First Boot

First boot aims to demonstrate correct operation of the prepared SD card and communication over the serial interface. This ensures all steps have been followed correctly prior to proceeding with compilation and execution of an seL4 binary.

## Prerequisites

Prior to powering the MaaXBoard ensure the following setup is in place, building on previous sections:

1. The SD card has been prepared as per the instructions in the [SD Card Preparation](../install_and_configure/bootloader_setup.md) section.

2. The MaaXBoard has been set up as per the [Target Platform Setup](../install_and_configure/target_setup.md) section with only the USB-to-TTL cable connected and the SD card inserted.

3. The USB-to-TTL cable is connected to the host machine with CoolTerm configured as per the [Host Setup](../install_and_configure/host_setup.md) section.

## Boot to U-Boot Prompt

At this stage power should be supplied to the MaaXBoard by connecting the USB-C power adapter. On supply of power the user should see the output of the bootloader displayed in CoolTerm/Minicom. As no `sel4_image` binary has been supplied the user should be dropped to the U-Boot command prompt.

The log below shows the serial terminal output on the host machine when the MaaXBoard boots with no access to a binary to execute.

Note that the serial terminal output does not include the line numbers shown in the example logs shown below; those line numbers have only been added afterwards for ease of reference in this documentation.

_Note: The CRC warning at line 20 is not an important issue; it is just an artefact from the basic U-Boot image, and the default environment variables are sufficient._

Once at the U-Boot prompt, the user can enter interactive U-Boot commands. For example:

- `help` to display the available commands;
- `printenv` to display the environment variables;
- `setenv` to set environment variables;
- `reset` to reset the CPU instead of physically cycling the power.

A full reference to U-Boot commands can be found [here](https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html?highlight=shell) but we only use a few of them directly in this developer kit.

The following sections build upon this step by demonstrating the building and execution of an seL4 application on the MaaXBoard.
