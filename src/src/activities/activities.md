# Activities

These techical activities provide a range of examples which seek to demonstrate how to develop with seL4. For each activity our development process is discussed which intends to shed light on the our experience with writing programs in seL4. This aims to show the lessons we learnt along the way and act as inspiration for others wishing to embark on writing their own systems and programs with seL4.
